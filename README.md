Team11- Health Management System

Overview -

The Healthcare Management System (HMS) is designed to digitize patient records and improve doctor-patient interactions. It includes secure authentication and role-based access control for doctors, patients, and staff. The system features electronic health records (EHR), enabling patients to upload their medical history, lab results, and prescriptions, while doctors can update consultation notes. Additionally, search and filtering functions allow for quick access to patient history, prescriptions, and diagnoses. To enhance patient care, the system includes health risk assessments using self-assessment questionnaires to evaluate potential risks such as diabetes, heart disease, and other health conditions. The system also automates prescription refill requests and tracks patient drug usage to ensure proper medication management. To maintain data security and compliance, the system employs encryption and HIPAA-compliant security measures to protect sensitive medical information.
